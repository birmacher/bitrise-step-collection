description: |
  Send a push notification with [Parse](https://parse.com/).

  To use their service you have to register first.
  It is possible to register a trial account for free.

  You can get the required keys and IDs from your parse app's page,
  similar to this: [https://www.parse.com/apps/your-parse-apps-name/edit#app_keys](https://www.parse.com/apps/your-parse-apps-name/edit#app_keys)

  You have to install your own Push Receiver app to receive the push notifications - you can find a
  template app here: [https://github.com/bitrise-io/example-parse-notification-center-ios-app](https://github.com/bitrise-io/example-parse-notification-center-ios-app)
